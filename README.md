# üîç Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository contains insights and benchmarking data about various techniques used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), as well as a practical guide to performing fine-tuning based on model size and task type.

## üìö Overview

Fine-tuning allows us to adapt general-purpose LLMs to specific tasks using targeted datasets. This repository summarizes:

- Fine-tuning techniques and their trade-offs
- Hardware and platform considerations
- A practical step-by-step guide
- Classification of fine-tuning methods by model size and use case

## üß† What is a Large Language Model?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model trained on massive text corpora to understand and generate human-like language. These models support applications like:

- Machine translation
- Conversational AI
- Summarization
- Domain-specific language generation

## üîß Fine-Tuning Techniques

### üß™ Types of Fine-Tuning
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**  
  Adapt a model using high-quality labeled data (e.g., instruction-response pairs).

- **Instruction Fine-Tuning**  
  Train on formatted prompts to teach models to follow human-like instructions.

- **Adapter-Based Tuning**  
  Insert lightweight layers into a frozen model, training only those layers.

- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**  
  Update only a subset of the model's parameters using techniques like:
  - LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
  - Prefix Tuning
  - Prompt Tuning

- **Unsupervised Fine-Tuning**  
  Use raw text from the target domain (e.g., medical/legal) without labeled data.

- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**  
  Fine-tune using human preference scoring to align outputs with human values.

## üß© Classification by Model Size

| Size   | Parameters         | Notes                          |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Small  | < 300M             | Fast training, limited power   |
| Medium | 300M ‚Äì 3B          | Balanced performance and cost  |
| Large  | > 3B               | High accuracy, costly training |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Fine-Tuning Workflow

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   `transformers`, `datasets`, `accelerate`, `torch`, etc.

2. **Prepare Dataset**  
   Load and preprocess your task-specific data.

3. **Load Pretrained Model and Tokenizer**  
   Use Hugging Face or another framework.

4. **Set Training Arguments**  
   Define `output_dir`, `batch_size`, `learning_rate`, `num_train_epochs`, etc.

5. **Train the Model**  
   Fine-tune using the appropriate technique.

6. **Evaluate and Save**  
   Assess performance and export the trained model.
